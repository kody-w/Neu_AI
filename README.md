# NeuAI

NeuAI is an advanced AI assistant that provides a unique, personalized conversational experience. Unlike traditional chatbots, NeuAI is designed to build and maintain relationships over time, offering a more intuitive and adaptive interaction.

## Key Features

- **Long-Term Memory**: NeuAI remembers past interactions, allowing for personalized conversations that evolve over time.
- **Adaptive Tool Utilization**: The assistant can select and use various tools based on the context of the conversation, enhancing its problem-solving capabilities.
- **Visible Thought Process**: NeuAI's internal thought process can be displayed, providing insight into its decision-making and learning mechanisms.
- **Simulation Modeling**: Potential for R&D applications, such as testing interaction capabilities for new services.
- **Open-Source**: The project is now open-source, allowing for community contributions and improvements.

## How NeuAI Differs from Other AI Assistants

1. **Relationship Building**: Unlike typical AI that resets after each interaction, NeuAI maintains context over extended periods, allowing for the development of a more human-like relationship with users.

2. **Adaptive Intelligence**: NeuAI can choose from a variety of tools and skills based on the conversation context, similar to how a human would select the appropriate tool for a task.

3. **Transparent Thinking**: The ability to view the AI's internal thought process provides unprecedented insight into its decision-making, enhancing trust and understanding between the AI and its users.

4. **Customizable and Extendable**: As an open-source project, NeuAI can be customized and extended to fit specific use cases or research needs.

## Potential Applications

- Personal AI assistant with long-term memory capabilities
- R&D tool for simulating and testing new service interactions
- Platform for exploring and developing more advanced, relation-based AI systems

## Responsible AI Considerations

NeuAI is designed with responsible AI principles in mind. However, users and developers should be aware of the following:

- Data Privacy: Ensure proper handling and protection of user data, especially given the long-term memory capabilities.
- User Consent: Implement clear mechanisms for user consent regarding data retention and learning processes.
- Transparency: Utilize the visible thought process feature to maintain transparency in AI decision-making.
